-   User story: I can see a page following the given design
-   User story: On mobile, I can see a collapsed navigation
-   User story: On mobile, when I select the hamburger menu, I can see a navigation
-   Technical requirement : use **BEM** notation with **SASS** to practice your skills

[Check the design link here](https://www.figma.com/file/3cf83hHRBAGjG5EKPcG2bV)

As long as you fulfill all the user stories, you can give your personal touches by adding transition, using your own images, changing colors, or even creating your own layout,...

Once you completed, submit your solutions by providing URLs for both GitHub repository and live app on Netlify and explain briefly what you have done.

Good luck everybody!

    I have deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), so you can see the demo by clicking on [this link](https://interior-consultant-page.netlify.app/").
-  Experience:
  I tried to use font-links in this project instead of my habit to use sass functions or @import. Working on a responsive design and inproving web performance.

In this project, my focus is on flexibility and positioning elements.
